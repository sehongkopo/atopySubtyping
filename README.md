“Transcriptomic Subtyping of Atopic Dermatitis Reveals Distinct Drug Response Signatures”
The goal of this project is to identify transcriptome-based molecular subtypes of atopic dermatitis (AD) and to investigate how these subtypes relate to differential responses to systemic therapies, particularly dupilumab and cyclosporine.

Atopic dermatitis exhibits substantial molecular and clinical heterogeneity, which is reflected in variable therapeutic outcomes.
In this study, we:

1. identified two distinct lesional molecular subtypes (major and minor) using bulk skin transcriptomic data.

2. Characterized subtype-specific differences in:

   > immune activation
   > cell-cycle–associated programs
   > immune cell composition

3. Evaluated subtype-specific drug responsiveness by integrating:

   > lesional vs. non-lesional expression signatures
   > drug-induced transcriptional changes after dupilumab or cyclosporine treatment

4. Validated findings using an independent cyclosporine-treated cohort with responder/non-responder annotations.
